## Self-learning Next.js

This is a simple todo app created in Next.js, bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. I followed [**Introduction to Next.js, v3**](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/next-js-v3/) by Scott Moss on Frontend Masters and added a personal touch with custom CSS.

<br />

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- **React** - JavaScript library for building Component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- **TailwindCSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **SQLite and Prisma** - SQLite is a lightweight database, and Prisma is an ORM for database management

<br />

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
